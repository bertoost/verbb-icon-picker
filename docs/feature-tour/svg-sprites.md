# SVG Sprites

SVG Sprites are a slightly more advanced method of combining your icons into a single SVG file - but there are a number of benefits to this method. To read more about SVG Sprite, see [https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts).

SVG Sprites should be placed in the root of your `iconSetsPath` folder.
